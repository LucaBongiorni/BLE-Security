# BLE Security

## BlueFinder
A rangefinding application used to identify and locate IEEE 802.15.1 devices. This application is capable of detecting and locating Bluetooth devices using the classic Bluetooth protocol and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BlueFinder is built to run on a Bluetooth adapter running BCM20702A0 drivers. his command line application uses the log-distance path loss model (LDPL) to calculate a distance estimate based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) from a target transceiver.

## Hacking Bluetooth Low Energy Locks
A Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack for communicating to BLE devices using the Host Controller Interface (HCI).
